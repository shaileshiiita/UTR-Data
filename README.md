# UTR-Data
UTR (Untranslated Regions) is very imortant non-coding part of genome. It controls almost every bilogical process i.e. from cell differentiation to gene expression. The data and code provide in the github is for analysis of UTR sequences. The UTR.exe is a PERL based program useed for transforming a sequence into genomic features. The genomics features are can be used for classifion of UTR sequences in to a specific class. The code takes input in FASTA format and generated a .txt or .xls file of genomics features. These genomic features are composed of mono, di, trimers, entropy and propelexity of a DNA sequence.

The method used is applicable for any DNA or RNA sequence.
